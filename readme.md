# My Pong

Having the idea to practice and implement HTML5 Canvas and vanilla-Javascript; the "old" PONG game is a great start.

Practicing canvas shape (Rect, Arc, Lines), place them in the canvas itself pixel by pixel, and interact with them via plain Javascript was a good review for JS, and a fantastic introduction to HTML5 Canvas.

This small project is a good reference and starting point for future Canvas application!
